          <p>
            Discover the joy of a scrumptious grilled cheese sandwich at 888
            Cheese & Co., a delightful eatery outside of Green Bay that opened
            its doors in December 2021. The simplicity and deliciousness of
            their gourmet grilled cheese creations will leave you craving for
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon entering 888 Cheese & Co., start by placing your order at the
            counter. I recommend reviewing their menu beforehand to be prepared
            when you reach the counter. If that's not possible, you can grab a
            menu from them and browse while waiting in line to place your order.
            After ordering, choose your seat, and they'll serve your food.

            During my visit to 888 Cheese and Co., I opted for the MAC Daddy
            (pictured above). It's a grilled cheese loaded with 888 Cheese and
            Co.â€™s extra creamy mac n cheese. I also ordered a side of their pub
            chips, while my wife chose a sandwich and their tomato soup. Both
            sides complemented the sandwiches well, but the tomato soup was
            absolutely incredible. I'm not a soup connoisseur, but that was the
            best tomato soup I've ever had.

            While dining at 888 Cheese and Co., we noticed they are next door to
            Ahnapee Brewery. Employees from 888 Cheese and Co. consistently
            delivered food to the brewery. If you're into craft beers and a
            delicious meal, you can order food from the brewery, and they will
            deliver it to you. It's a win-win!
          </p>
          <p>
            888 Cheese and Co. will be a frequent dining spot for us. It offers
            the kind of meal that soothes your soul during a Wisconsin winter.
            If you're a grilled cheese enthusiast like us, I highly recommend
            giving them a try.

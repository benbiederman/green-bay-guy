            During my recent visit to 888 Cheese & Co., I couldn't resist trying
            their signature dish, the MAC Daddy (pictured above). This
            mouthwatering grilled cheese features 888 Cheese and Co.'s extra
            creamy mac n cheese, making it an irresistible treat. As a side, I
            opted for their flavorful pub chips, while my wife chose a
            delectable sandwich paired with their heavenly tomato soup. Let me
            tell you, that soup was divine, even for someone like me who isn't a
            soup expert. It was hands down the best tomato soup I've ever
            savored.

            One delightful surprise during our dining experience at 888 Cheese &
            Co. was its proximity to Ahnapee Brewery next door. The staff at 888
            Cheese & Co. were frequently delivering food to the brewery. It's a
            fantastic arrangement, allowing you to savor both craft beers and a
            mouthwatering meal. A true win/win for any food and beer enthusiast!

          <h1>La Carreta</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to La Carreta, a Mexican restaurant serving delicious dishes
            since 2019. La Carreta offers a wide variety of tasty items, but
            it's best known for its incredible birria. They serve their birria
            in tacos, subs, salsas, and even in ramen, and they even make their
            own rendition of a birria pizza.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I stepped into La Carreta, the first thing that caught my eye was
            the vibrant array of colors and decorations. The walls were adorned
            with bright greens, yellows, and pinks, while decorative items such
            as sombreros, beer signs, and tequila barrel lids added to the
            lively ambiance. The vibe was set from the moment you walked in.
          </p>
          <p>
            One notable aspect of their menu is that it's in Spanish, with some
            items translated into English. If you're unsure of what you want and
            are unable to read Spanish, they have a video menu board that
            displays the English menu. Alternatively, you can ask your waiter
            for assistance, or browse the menu on your phone.

            As La Carreta is famous for its birria, I decided to try their Taco
            de Quesabirria, which is translated to a birria taco with cheese.
            However, it's more than just that. They prepare it by placing a
            tortilla on the flat top, covering it with cheese, cooking until
            it's melted, then adding another tortilla filled with birria. It's
            like a quesadilla transformed into a taco shell filled with birria.
            The taco comes served with a side of broth to dip in. Let me tell
            you – the hype is real. The tacos were flavorful and ooey-gooey from
            all the melty cheese.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following my meal, I learned that La Carreta has been selling their
            birria for over two decades, starting in Guadalajara, Mexico. Their
            recipes are as authentic as you can get, creating a perfect
            opportunity for you to taste the authenticity. It’s no wonder that
            it’s resulted in great success in Green Bay, attracting guests such
            as Simone Biles and Aaron Jones.
          </p>
          <p>I can’t wait for my next visit to La Carreta.</p>

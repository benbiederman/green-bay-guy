          <h1>Four-way Bar and Restaurant</h1>
          <p>
            Four-Way Bar & Restaurant, situated in Suamico, has gained
            popularity for its renowned Friday fish fry. This establishment,
            operating since 1978 and proudly family-owned, is a delightful
            combination of a bar and restaurant (as suggested by the name). With
            a diverse array of dishes on their menu, Four-Way Bar & Restaurant
            caters to a wide range of tastes, ensuring there's something
            appealing for every diner.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to describing my experience at the restaurant,
            "cluster" is the word that immediately comes to mind. Upon arriving
            at the bustling location, I approached the hostess desk but ended up
            waiting for around five minutes before someone noticed me and
            inquired about my needs. I expressed my interest in getting a table
            and was informed that I needed to speak with the bartenders to
            obtain a number, which would determine the order of service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navigating through the crowded bar, I finally managed to get my
            number after a few more minutes of waiting. I settled for a small
            table in the bar area and eagerly awaited my turn. The service
            proceeded based on the assigned numbers, so when my turn came up, a
            waitress came over to take my order. The food was promptly brought
            to the table, but to my surprise, there were no drinks accompanying
            the meal. It was then that I discovered I should have placed the
            drink order at the bar instead of through the waitress.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing my meal, a while had passed, and I was still waiting
            for my bill. At this point, I approached the person who had taken my
            food order to inquire about it. To my chagrin, she directed me to
            settle the bill at the bar. I had to make my way back to the already
            crowded bar area to have the bartenders handle the payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflecting on the entire process, I can't help but feel exhausted
            just recounting it all over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regarding the food, it was decent overall. The wings, in particular,
            stood out as they had a unique twist – being breaded like fried
            chicken – which turned out to be better than I had initially
            anticipated.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, one aspect that left me a bit surprised was the price. I
            ordered 12 wings at 50 cents each according to the menu, along with
            fries and a coke. Logically, the bill should have come to a total of
            $6 for the wings plus the cost of fries and the drink. But to my
            astonishment, my bill ended up being $16, which didn't align with my
            calculations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite feeling unsure about the total, I hesitated to question it
            at the time. The bartenders were swamped with their tasks, trying to
            handle multiple customers' orders and payments simultaneously. As a
            result, I felt a bit awkward about raising the issue and opted to
            pay the amount indicated on the bill without further inquiry.

          <p>
            If you're searching for hidden gems in Green Bay, Drift Inn is the
            perfect spot you've been seeking. It's one of those places that
            somehow stays under the radar, but once you visit, you'll wonder why
            it's not more popular. While their menu offers a wide range of
            delicious items, such as burgers, fish, and cheese curds, their fame
            truly lies in their mouthwatering chili. In Green Bay, the words
            "Drift Inn" and "great chili" go hand in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before planning your visit to Drift Inn, make sure to check their
            hours, as they vary throughout the year. During the Summer (May to
            the end of September), they're open from 11:00 am to 11:30 pm,
            Monday through Friday. In the Winter (October to the end of April),
            they also open on Saturdays from 11:00 am to 8:30 pm.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you step inside the restaurant, you'll find plenty of tables.
            There's no need to wait for a hostess; just seat yourself. Although
            there might not be a sign indicating it, feel free to choose an
            empty table and take a look at the napkin holder. Yes, that's where
            they've cleverly printed their menu. Don't worry; I've got you
            covered with a picture of it below, so you can come prepared. Keep
            in mind that prices may vary, but I've got all the delicious food
            options listed for you.

            Here's a helpful tip: It's a good idea to arrive with an idea of
            what you'd like to order. Some servers can be a bit hasty, expecting
            you to know your choice so they can quickly turn the tables. So,
            take a glance at the menu beforehand and decide what you're craving
            right from the start.

            The food at Drift Inn is simple, yet incredibly delicious. As I
            mentioned before, their chili is a must-try and what they're
            well-known for. However, they also serve classic favorites you'd
            expect from a top-notch dive bar.
          </p>

          <h1>Lambeau Field Parking Guide</h1>
          <p>
            So, you've decided to attend a Packers game, which is great! Now,
            you might be wondering where to park when you attend the game. Green
            Bay offers one of the most unique stadium experiences in all of
            professional sports, in my opinion.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you get closer to the stadium, you'll notice homeowners standing
            on their lawns, holding signs advertising parking for a small fee.
            Since Green Bay doesn't have any parking garages near the stadium,
            homeowners help alleviate the lack of parking by renting out their
            lawns. Depending on how close you park to the stadium, you can
            expect to pay anywhere from $0 to $50+ for a parking spot.
          </p>

          <h2>What took look for in a lawn parking spot:</h2>
          <p>
            Lawn parking around Lambeau Field is highly competitive. Homeowners
            use various strategies to attract customers, offering perks such as
            access to bathrooms, tailgating opportunities, and easy in/easy out
            access. To me, the most crucial perk you want from a lawn parking
            spot is easy in/easy out access. Essentially, this means they won't
            block your vehicle in. Some lawns may cram cars in, leading to a
            frustrating wait when trying to leave after the game.
          </p>

          <h2>
            "Is there anywhere else I can park aside from someone's lawn?"
          </h2>
          <p>
            Absolutely. You can also find local businesses selling parking
            spaces in their lots. Businesses located close to Lambeau Field,
            such as <a href="/locals-guide/the-bar.html">The Bar</a>,
            <a href="/locals-guide/green-bay-distillery.html"
              >Green Bay Distillery</a
            >, or <a href="/locals-guide/krolls-west.html">Krollâ€™s</a>, often
            sell parking spaces on game day. There are pros and cons to both
            parking options.
          </p>
          <h2>
            "What's better? Parking on someone's lawn or in a business parking
            lot?"
          </h2>
          <p>
            It depends on your preferences and comfort level. Generally, you can
            find more affordable parking by choosing someone's lawn. Given the
            competitive market in the community, lawn parking spots are usually
            reasonably priced. The only downside is that you might have to walk
            a bit more compared to parking at a business. When parking in a
            business lot, you get the convenience of well-defined parking spaces
            and the opportunity to tailgate. The atmosphere can be more
            rewarding, especially for first-time game attendees, as you'll be
            surrounded by fans who are also tailgating. Another option is to
            purchase a parking pass at Lambeau Field before the game, allowing
            you to park as close as possible. However, as of my last update, a
            parking spot at Lambeau Field costs $50. There are also parking lots
            farther from the stadium that still offer tailgating opportunities,
            giving you a balance of price, location, and experience.
          </p>
          <h2>"Do I have to pay for parking?"</h2>
          <p>
            If you don't mind a little walking, you can usually find free
            parking options. Personally, I always opt for free parking when
            attending games. However, there are a couple of drawbacks to
            consider. First, it's often more challenging to tailgate since
            you're parking on the street for free. Second, you may have to walk
            a bit to reach the stadium. Nonetheless, after a cold game, it's
            nice to thaw your legs on the way back to the car. What I
            particularly like about free parking is that it allows for a
            smoother exit strategy. You can identify areas near stop signs,
            which can help you navigate through traffic more easily. If you
            don't plan your exit strategy while parking, you might find yourself
            stuck in traffic, waiting for a break to leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're looking for free parking, check Google Maps for
            neighborhoods around Lambeau Field. While most streets around
            Lambeau Field allow parking on game days, not all of them do.
            Therefore, as you park, be sure to watch for signs indicating
            parking restrictions. The last thing you want after a game is to
            deal with a parking ticket or worse.
          </p>

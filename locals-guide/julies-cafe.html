            One of the things that sets Julie's Cafe apart is their generous
            portion sizes at unbeatable prices. For instance, I recently enjoyed
            a delightful plate of two fluffy blueberry pancakes for less than $6
            (as shown in the picture above). Despite their affordable prices,
            Julie's Cafe never compromises on quality. Unlike other
            establishments that rely on pre-packaged ingredients, Julie's Cafe
            takes pride in preparing everything from scratch. Just one bite of
            their house-made hash browns will leave you craving more. It's no
            wonder they have multiple locations throughout Green Bay!

          <h1>Basil's II</h1>
          <p>
            Get those extra napkins ready, because for this review, we visited
            Basil's II. Located in Denmark, WI, Basil's II is a bar/restaurant
            known for its butter burgers and great prices. With a vast menu,
            Basil's II offers something for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, if you're planning on visiting Basil's II, be aware that
            it's located just outside of Green Bay, roughly 15-20 miles away.
            Although it's mostly backroads to get there, the journey is well
            worth it. Unlike some small-town bars that can make you feel
            alienated, Basil's II has a welcoming atmosphere. The bartender
            kindly explained their process to us without making us feel out of
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of the process, at Basil's II, if you're looking to eat,
            you would go to the bar to get menus. Once you've decided what you
            want, you place your order with the bartenders, who then assign you
            a table. It's a slightly different process, but it seems to work
            well for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to the food, you definitely get bang for your buck. We
            ordered a cheeseburger, double bacon cheeseburger, perch sandwich,
            french fries, potato wedges, and cheese curds, all for a total of
            $26. The portion sizes were generous, more than enough for the three
            of us. The food itself was excellent. While places like
            <a href="/locals-guide/krolls-west.html">Krolls</a> and
            <a href="/locals-guide/drift-inn.html">The Drift Inn</a> are often
            praised for their butter burgers, I personally prefer Basil's II
            over both of those locations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be straightforward. My photo of the butter burger is horrendous
            â€“ that thing was a mess, but its deliciousness matched its
            messiness. The double cheeseburger was bursting with flavor, thanks
            to the high-quality beef and the butter seeping through the burger.
            Please don't let the messiness discourage you from trying out this
            incredible spot!
          </p>
          <p>
            So, if you're up for a scenic ride to savor some great food, look no
            further than Basil's II. We can't wait to return, and we're sure
            you'll feel the same!

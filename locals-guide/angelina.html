            Prepare to be pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes at Angelina.
            I initially thought I might leave hungry, but boy, was I wrong!
            Their in-house-made fresh pasta left us so satisfied that dessert
            became an impossible mission. The ravioli in their bolognese meat
            sauce was a revelation—unlike anything I've ever tasted in Italian
            cuisine. Comparing it to my previous experience at Grazies Italian
            Grill, which has since closed, the contrast was night and day. I
            must admit, I had to resist the urge to lick the bowl clean—a
            testament to the exceptional quality of the food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hands down, if you're on the hunt for an exceptional dinner spot,
            Angelina is at the top of my recommendations. Trust me; you won't
            regret making this choice. I'm already counting down the days until
            my next visit.

          <h1>Packers Heritage Trail</h1>
          <p>
            If you've ever heard of the Packers, you probably know they have a
            rich history. The Green Bay Packers stand out from other NFL teams
            because of their long and interesting past. One of the most exciting
            activities to experience in Green Bay, especially if you're a
            Packers fan, is exploring their rich heritage. And here's the best
            part: it won't break the bank, except for a bit of gas money and
            perhaps some cash for snacks along the way.
          </p>

            This tour might take a bit of your time, depending on what you want
            to see. Part of the trail is a 3-mile walk that will lead you
            through different parts of downtown Green Bay. But some places might
            require you to hop in a car to reach them. If you're into history
            like me, you're in for a treat. You'll get to visit important places
            like Curly's birthplace home, his grave site, and Lombardi's family
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you plan to take the Heritage Trail, it's a good idea to check
            out the Heritage Trail Map first. You can decide which places you
            want to visit and plan your route. If you're visiting from out of
            town and don't have a car, don't worry. The Packers offer trolley
            tours that you can
            <a

              >purchase tickets</a
            >
            to before your trip, so you'll have them ready when you arrive in
            Green Bay.
          </p>
          <p>
            One more great thing about this trail is that it takes you along the
            CityDeck, which is a beautiful addition to downtown Green Bay. It's
            a lovely spot to be on a nice day. And while you're walking, you can
            take a break at
            <a href="/locals-guide/copper-state-brewing-co.html"
              >Copper State Brewing</a
            >
            for a cold drink or some tasty cheese curds. It's a no-brainer â€“ a
            fun and free way to soak in Packers history and enjoy the city!

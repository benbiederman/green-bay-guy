            One of the aspects that truly stood out during my visit was the
            unique touch of a pickle dish. Brickhouse Burgers offers three
            different types of pickles, giving you the freedom to explore and
            enjoy various flavors with your burger. I had a feeling that these
            pickles were homemade, a testament to the care and attention
            Brickhouse Craft Burgers and Brews puts into the quality of their
            offerings.

            For starters, their appetizer menu boasts a nice variety of options.
            Being true Wisconsinites, we opted for the deep-fried cheesecurds.
            While they were light and fluffy with delicious homemade sauces, I
            personally felt they lacked a bit of crunch. Nevertheless, they are
            definitely worth trying, especially if you're a fan of cheesy
            delights.

            Now, about the burgers â€“ they were decent, but I wasn't left in awe.
            However, I'm more than willing to return and give another burger a
            shot. The inviting atmosphere and friendly vibe of the restaurant
            make it a great place to enjoy a burger and beer, especially if
            these are your go-to choices for a satisfying meal.

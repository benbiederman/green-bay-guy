          <h1>Coffee Wizardz</h1>
          <p>
            Relatively new to the Green Bay area, opening in December 2021, is
            Coffee Wizardz. Coffee Wizardz is known for their delicious coffee
            and welcoming atmosphere. With Coffee Wizardz being so new to the
            area, I was very excited to get into their location and see what
            they have to offer.
          </p>
          <h2>What to expect if coming to Coffee Wizardz</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re coming to Green Bay and looking for an amazing place to
            grab some coffee, this is the place you’re looking for. Sam and his
            team at Coffee Wizardz create a very warm, welcoming environment for
            anyone who steps foot in their store.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the environment Coffee Wizardz creates is incredible, their
            coffee is even better. I’ve been to Coffee Wizardz a concerning
            number of times since it opened and I have yet to have a bad
            experience. In fact, Coffee Wizardz products are some of the best
            I’ve ever had. Coffee Wizardz has effectively ruined lattes for me
            at other coffee places in the area. I don’t know what the secret is
            for making such an incredible espresso drink, but Coffee Wizardz has
            it.
          </p>
          <h3>Some callouts if you're coming to Coffee Wizardz</h3>
          <p>
            Their menu is quite limited. They have a standing menu of items that
            are always offered, then they have seasonal drinks. While this may
            seem like a flaw, personally I really like this. I’d much rather
            have a consistent, high-quality product over a more customizable
            product that is meh.
          </p>
          <p>
            The portion sizes for some drinks at Coffee Wizardz are a bit more
            on the modest size. You won’t find 30oz iced drinks like you would
            at a chain coffee joint. Once again, I’m in the camp that I’d rather
            have a smaller amount of something incredible than a large amount of
            something that is meh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the beverages are only offered if you’re planning on
            enjoying it at Coffee Wizardz. From my experience, this only occurs
            for some of their seasonal drinks. The reason for this is because
            they serve it differently than the rest of their products and want
            to ensure that it’s being served for maximum quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cannot recommend Coffee Wizardz enough to anyone who loves coffee.
            Life is too short to only be drinking from chain coffee joints. Go
            experience the magic that Coffee Wizardz offers (pun definitely
            intended). After writing this, I think I’m going to need some Coffee
            Wizardz myself.

          <h1>R & D's House Divided</h1>
          <p>
            Discover R & D House Divided, a unique Packers Bears bar situated on
            University Ave in Green Bay. With one owner being a Packers fan and
            the other a Bears fan, the concept intrigued me, prompting a visit
            to this intriguing spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon entering R & D House Divided, you'll find a warm and welcoming
            atmosphere with various tables and a bar at the front. Unlike
            traditional restaurants, here, you can choose your own table without
            waiting to be seated. The walls are adorned with a delightful mix of
            Packers and Bears memorabilia, creating the perfect ambiance for
            sports enthusiasts. While there seems to be a slight preference for
            Packers items, it's only fitting given the bar's location in Green
            Bay.

            During our visit, we were greeted by an incredibly friendly
            bartender who exuded enthusiasm, making us feel right at home. Our
            waitress promptly took our drink orders, and to our surprise, we
            were served R & D House Divided bottles of water. This unique touch
            of branding was interesting, although it's worth noting that the
            water is only available in $2 bottles rather than traditional
            glasses.
          </p>

            Moving on to the food, I opted for the Italian beef sandwich,
            expecting a taste reminiscent of the ones served at renowned Chicago
            spots like Portillo's or Taste of the Windy City (formerly in Green
            Bay). However, the sandwich's beef was cut a bit thicker and piled
            on rather than thinly sliced, deviating from the classic style.
            Despite this, the sandwich was still enjoyable. In general, the food
            received a decent rating from our group of four, but nothing
            particularly stood out.
          </p>

            R & D House Divided unquestionably presents a fascinating concept,
            but in terms of the culinary experience, it might not have left a
            lasting impression on us. Personally, I might prefer heading further
            down the road to
            <a href="/locals-guide/legend-larrys.html">Legend Larry's</a> for a
            meal. However, one aspect that did shine during our visit was the
            wonderful waitress who made the experience delightful with her
            cheerful demeanor and quick service. If you're looking to enjoy a
            drink with your Bears fan friend, this bar might be worth
            considering, but as far as the food goes, there might be other
            options worth exploring.

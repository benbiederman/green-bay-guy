          <h1>Aldo's Pizza</h1>
          <p>
            If you're searching for a charming spot in Green Bay that's been
            delighting locals for over 50 years, look no further than Aldo's
            Pizza. Established in 1969, this cozy eatery has earned a loyal
            following with its unique offerings. Let's take a closer look at my
            recent visit to Aldo's Pizza.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we pulled up to the location, it resembled an old-fashioned
            house-turned-restaurant. The exterior didn't immediately give away
            its culinary treasures, and if I hadn't been determined to try it, I
            might have overlooked it. But we ventured inside and found a cozy
            dining area that efficiently used its space to accommodate guests.
            Seating ourselves, we noticed the quirky decor adorned with
            memorabilia of The Three Stooges â€“ an interesting and unexpected
            touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ordered a classic Wisconsin treat, a plate of cheese curds, and
            Aldo's famed 14x17 pizza, well-known among locals. The cheese curds
            were delicious, as expected, but the pizza was a unique surprise.
            Unlike the usual circular pizzas, Aldo's serves their scrumptious
            creation in a rectangular shape. The crust was thin and flaky, and
            they generously loaded it with pepperoni and cheese, creating a
            savory delight that left us wanting more.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, one peculiarity stood out during our visit. Even though we
            dined in, the restaurant provided us with just one small styrofoam
            plate each, only big enough to hold a single slice of their square
            pizza. While not a deal-breaker, it was an odd aspect of our
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            All in all, Aldo's Pizza offers great food, but I'm not sure it's a
            place I'd frequent regularly. When seeking an extraordinary pizza
            experience, I'd personally lean towards
            <a href="/locals-guide/rustique-pizzeria.html">Rustique Pizzeria</a
            >. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate to enjoy Aldo's Pizza again if
            the opportunity presented itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next time you're in Green Bay and on the hunt for a taste of local
            history, head over to Aldo's Pizza.

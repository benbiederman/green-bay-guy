          <h1>CityDeck</h1>
          <p>
            If you're seeking a wonderful spot in Green Bay that won't cost you
            a dime, CityDeck should be on your list. It's a lovely place to
            unwind and bask in the serene waterside atmosphere. You'll find a
            spot where kids can dash through sprays of water, creating joyous
            moments. But CityDeck isn't just for youngsters; it's a great place
            for everyone to wind down, especially after a long day, as you soak
            in a breathtaking sunset.
          </p>
          <p>
            CityDeck is meticulously designed for your relaxation and enjoyment.
            It offers a handful of bars right along the waterfront (those you'll
            need your wallet for), where you can sip a refreshing beverage on
            their outdoor patios. One standout is Hagemeister Park, boasting a
            charming patio area that's perfect for those crisp autumn evenings.
            They even have cozy fires to keep you warm.
          </p>
          <p>
            When planning your visit, CityDeck's website mentions operating
            hours as Monday to Sunday, 6:30 am to 10:00 pm. However, it's worth
            noting that you can often visit well beyond 10:00 pm without any
            trouble. The area appears to be open for strolls at all hours. We've
            included the listed hours from their website below, but it's good to
            know that these hours may be more of a suggestion than a strict
            rule.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you're simply unwinding, sipping a drink, taking a leisurely
            stroll, or trying your luck at fishing, CityDeck offers a pleasant
            experience. You can also explore the surroundings and drop by local
            shops. What makes CityDeck even more appealing is that it won't dent
            your wallet. This is especially handy if you're a visitor, as travel
            expenses can add up quickly. So, why not check out Green Bay's
            CityDeck for a memorable and budget-friendly way to enjoy Green Bay?

          <h1>Black Honey Hashery</h1>
          <p>
            Looking for a hidden gem breakfast place in Green Bay? Look no
            further than Black Honey Hashery, a delightful eatery nestled in De
            Pere. Since its establishment in 2017, Black Honey Hashery has been
            delighting locals with its top-notch meals and delicious coffee. As
            a curious food enthusiast, I couldn't wait to explore this place and
            share my experience with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            While my visit to Black Honey Hashery was overall enjoyable, I must
            mention the only drawback I encountered—the parking situation. The
            lot is on the smaller side, making it a bit challenging to find a
            spot during busy times. Fear not! I'd suggest parking on the road or
            the parking lot slightly kitty-corner for easier access.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I entered, I was met with a warm and bustling atmosphere. The
            cozy space was filled with tables occupied by happy patrons. A
            friendly waitress named Lauren greeted us with a cheerful smile and
            promptly took our drink orders. I was delighted to learn that they
            serve Colectivo Coffee as their drip coffee, offering a premium
            coffee experience unlike some diners that serve subpar alternatives.
            If you're a coffee enthusiast like me, you can even take home a bag
            of their exquisite coffee or indulge in their premium coffee while
            using their convenient drive-thru.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, let's talk about the food—the real star of the show! The
            biscuits and gravy at Black Honey Hashery were nothing short of
            spectacular. The biscuits, which I assume were homemade, were
            mouthwatering garlic cheddar delights that reminded me of the
            heavenly cheesy biscuits at Red Lobster. As for the gravy, it was
            simply phenomenal—rich, flavorful, and generously packed with ground
            sausage in every spoonful. Simply incredible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Black Honey Hashery is certainly going to be a place that I frequent
            often. It's the perfect place to grab an incredible breakfast or a
            delicious cup of coffee.

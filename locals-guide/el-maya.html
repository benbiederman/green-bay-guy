          <h1>El Maya</h1>
          <p>
            Discover El Maya, a Mexican restaurant nestled in the same strip as
            Festival Foods in De Pere, Green Bay area. With numerous 'El'
            Mexican restaurants around, let's explore how El Maya stands out
            among its counterparts like
            <a href="/locals-guide/el-sarape.html">El Sarape</a> and the late El
            Presidente.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relocated to its current spot after its former location became a
            Kwik Trip (a very Wisconsin thing, indeed!), El Maya welcomed me
            with its new setup and scrumptious food. As I stepped inside, I
            couldn't help but marvel at the most impressive statue I've ever
            laid eyes on - a guy donning a sombrero, enjoying a cigar, and
            flaunting a cool handlebar mustache while proudly sporting a Rodgers
            jersey. A unique touch that sets the restaurant apart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, let me admit something about myself - when I visit Mexican
            restaurants, I tend to stick to my tried and tested favorite:
            burritos. El Maya was no exception. One thing that caught my
            attention while waiting for my order was that their chips weren't
            freshly made, a minor detail that stood out compared to other
            places. Nonetheless, I was eager to dig into their burrito, only to
            find a different approach from El Presidente and El Sarape. At El
            Maya, the meat was nestled inside the tortilla, while the other
            ingredients surrounded the plate or rested on top of the tortilla. A
            unique take, though I usually prefer the classic all-in-one wrap for
            the ultimate convenience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of taste, the ground hamburger in El Maya's burrito
            exceeded my expectations, delivering a delightful flavor. However,
            it felt more like a big taco than a traditional burrito, which was
            the only downside for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            To sum it up, El Maya offers a pretty good dining experience, but
            I'm not sure if it'll become my go-to spot for Mexican cuisine in
            Green Bay. Personal preference leads me to choose
            <a href="/locals-guide/el-sarape.html">El Sarape</a> every time,
            mainly due to their generous portion sizes, reasonable prices, and
            overall style.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a Mexican dining adventure in the Green Bay area, consider
            giving El Maya a try and see where it ranks on your list of favorite
            'El' restaurants!

            Looking for a classic dining experience near Lambeau Field in Green
            Bay? Look no further than Kroll's West, a beloved local joint
            serving up mouthwatering butter burgers and cheese curds.
            Conveniently situated next to the famous stadium, this restaurant
            has become a go-to spot for locals and tourists alike.

            charming old-school diner. The cozy atmosphere features round booths
            and speedy wait staff, ready to make your dining experience

            One of the highlights of Kroll's is the nostalgic decor. Vintage
            Packer memorabilia adorns the walls, and they proudly display a
            collection of autographed cards from various celebrities. It's a
            treat to immerse yourself in the rich history of this cherished
            eatery.

            Of course, the star attractions at Kroll's West are their
            scrumptious butter burgers and delectable cheese curds. Here's a fun
            fact – they offer a delightful variety of cheese curds, letting you
            choose between white, yellow, or a mix of both. It's a cheese
            lover's paradise!

            I know this might be controversial to say, but I must admit that I'm
            not the biggest fan of Kroll's West. While I'd recommend it to
            frequent Green Bay visitors, it's essential to consider that it can
            be a bit pricier than some other options in the area. Its location
            near Lambeau Field naturally draws many tourists, especially during
            game times, which contributes to its popularity and slightly higher
            prices. Consequently, it tends to get quite busy, which can impact
            the quality and speed of service. For those who want to experience
            Kroll's West at least once, it is still worth a try. However, if
            you're like me and prefer heartier burgers at a more affordable
            price, you might want to explore
            <a href="/locals-guide/basils-ii.html">Basil's II</a> or
            <a href="/locals-guide/basils-ii.html">Drift Inn</a>, where you can
            find more substantial options that won't break the bank.

            Green Bay boasts an array of fantastic dining spots, so choose
            wisely depending on your preferences. That said, a visit to Kroll's
            West for their scrumptious cheese curds is an acceptable choice in
            my eyes.

          <h1>Chad N.</h1>
          <p>
            On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down and speak
            with Chad. Chad and I cover a wide range of topics and hear many
            stories that he’s collected from over the years of being Packers
            fan. Chad and I discuss how he became a memorabilia collector (his
            collection is borderline hoarding… haha), we speak about his
            experiences with meeting many players over the years, his memories
            of Packers games, and much more. Chad shares some stories I won’t
            ever forget.

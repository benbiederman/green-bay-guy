          <p>
            During this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I have the
            opportunity to hear Travis' story. Travis, a huge Packers fan, hails
            from the Carolinas and now resides in Italy. In our conversation, we
            cover a wide variety of topics, from how he became a Packers fan to
            the differences between an NFL game and a game of futbol. This
            episode is my longest to date, and for a great reasonâ€”Travis had so
            much to share. I'm confident you'll love this episode as much as I
            did.

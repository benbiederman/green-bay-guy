          <h1>Oren Burks</h1>
          <p>
            On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I am joined by
            current Packer, Oren Burks. This episode was recorded midway through
            his rookie season, right after the Rams game. During our
            conversation, Oren and I discuss his draft experience, what he
            enjoys doing in his free time, first impressions of Green Bay, and
            much more.

          <p>
            On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down and speak
            with a great Packers fan named Peter. Peter resides in beautiful
            Denmark (the country, not Denmark, Wisconsin). During our
            conversation, we explore how one becomes a Packers fan in a European
            country, Peter's trips to Lambeau Field, his game day rituals, and
            much more. Peter was also kind enough to share some tips on making
            great smoked food for game day. I'm grateful that Peter took the
            time to tell his story, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

          <h1>Joe P.</h1>
          <p>
            For this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by
            Joe. Joe and I have known each other for quite some time now from
            all the hours spent together at training camp. During our
            conversation, we discuss training camp, Ha-Ha Clinton Dix (recorded
            prior to the trade deadline), autographs by mail, and much more. Joe
            is never short of stories, making him a perfect guest for an
            episode.

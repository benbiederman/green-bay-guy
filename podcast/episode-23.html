          <p>
            On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I am joined by
            former Packers running back, DuJuan Harris. It was such an awesome
            opportunity to hear his stories. During the episode, we talk about
            what he's been up to lately, his first touchdown at Lambeau Field,
            Aaron Rodgers' pranks, and much more. I'm so excited for you to hear
            this episode. It was a ton of fun to record, and I hope you enjoy it
            as much as I did.

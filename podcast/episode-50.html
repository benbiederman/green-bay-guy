          <h1>Ben B. / The Green Bay Guy</h1>
          <p>
            On this week's episode of The Green Bay Narrative, we're mixing it
            all up. Instead of me interviewing a guest, Wade (from episode #01)
            is interviewing me to hear my stories. During our conversation, we
            talk about the podcast, the future of the website/content, how I
            became a Packers fan, my favorite player, and so much more. It's
            quite a long episode, originally intended to be a two-parter.

            I'd like to take an opportunity to thank all of you for your support
            over the past 50 episodes. Whether you've listened to one episode or
            all 50, I can't thank you enough. When I initially set out to do
            this podcast, I had no idea what to expect or how long it would go.
            I'm so grateful I had the opportunity to hear the stories I did and
            get to know the people I did from the podcast. While the podcast may
            be coming to an end for now, it's not the end of The Green Bay Guy.
            I'll continue to be updating the website and creating content.

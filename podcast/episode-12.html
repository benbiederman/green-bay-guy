          <p>
            On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down with Jackie,
            a born and bred Wisconsinite and Green Bay Packer die-hard. I kick
            off the episode by sharing a funny personal story from the first
            time I met Jackie, and then we dive into her stories. Discover what
            it's like growing up as a Packers fan in Wisconsin, meeting Brett
            Favre, her initial trips to Green Bay, and much more. It was truly
            enjoyable sitting down with Jackie and hearing her story, especially
            since we've spent many hours talking Packers before. It was great to
            officially hear Jackie's story, and I hope you all enjoy it as much
            as I did.

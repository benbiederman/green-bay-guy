          <p>
            This week on The Green Bay Narrative, I'm joined by John, a die-hard
            Packers fan who resides in the Green Bay area. During our
            conversation, we discuss his fandom, his journey to being sober for
            10 years, the memorable Packers/Bears Week 1 matchup in the 2018
            season, and much more. John brought a lot of great energy to the
            episode, and it was really wonderful to hear his stories.

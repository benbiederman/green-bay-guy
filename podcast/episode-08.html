            Duke spends his Sundays preaching the good word, only to go home and
            chant the good words (Go Pack Go!). On today's episode, we delve
            into how Duke became a Packers fan despite growing up outside of
            Wisconsin, the Packers/Cowboys rivalry, and his first trip to
            Lambeau Field. Duke's positivity and great perspective are extremely
            refreshing. It was truly an honor to sit down and speak with him on
            this episode. Sit back and enjoy Duke's stories in this episode of
            The Green Bay Narrative.

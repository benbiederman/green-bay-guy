          <p>
            On this episode, we sit down with Curt, a California native and
            die-hard Packers fan. Curt and I have quite an extensive history,
            knowing each other for quite some time. Even with my long
            acquaintance with Curt, I was pleased to hear some new and unique
            stories that he had never shared with me before. In this episode, we
            delve into how Curt became a Packers fan, how he got to know
            players, Packers training camp, and much more. I think you'll really
            enjoy Curt's story as much as I did.

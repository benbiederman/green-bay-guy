          <p>
            The story of how you became a fan of your team is always
            interesting, especially when that team isn't readily available where
            you reside. In this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, we speak
            with Corey, who resides in beautiful Australia. During our
            conversation, we discuss how Corey became a fan while being from
            Australia, his first trip to Green Bay, game day traditions given
            the huge timezone difference, and much more. I'm also going on
            record to say Corey has the best accent we've heard thus far.

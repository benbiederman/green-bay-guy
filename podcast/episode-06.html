          <p>
            During this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I sit down with the
            creator of Packers Memes, now better known as Matt Ramage. Recorded
            prior to his page name change, our conversation delves into what
            inspired him to start his page, his experience growing up in Green
            Bay, the time he hung out with Tom Crabtee, and much more. Matt and
            I go way back, so it was a pleasure to sit down and hear his
            stories. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed
            recording it.

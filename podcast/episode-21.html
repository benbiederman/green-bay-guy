          <p>
            On this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, I have a conversation
            with Rob, whom I discovered while scrolling on Instagram. Rob was
            kind enough to agree to share his stories on our podcast. With
            arguably the coolest Instagram account out there, Rob has a lot of
            fascinating experiences to talk about. During our conversation, we
            discuss his travels, his favorite games he's attended, his visit to
            Green Bay, and much more.

          <p>
            For this episode of The Green Bay Narrative, Jason battled the
            elements to get to my house during a snowstorm, and he didn't risk
            his life for nothing. His episode is filled with hilarious stories
            that will leave you wanting more. We'll delve into game day rituals
            at his bar, his Packers Buddha, and much more. You won't regret
            listening to this episode with Jason.

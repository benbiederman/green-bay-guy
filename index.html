          <p>
            Back in October 2017, I kicked off The Green Bay Guy as a way to
            help folks heading to Green Bay get the inside scoop on all the
            fantastic spots to eat, drink, and have a blast in town. Honestly, I
            never thought it would grow into what it is today. It's been an
            incredible journey, and this project has allowed me to connect with
            some truly amazing people, hear their awesome stories, and become
            even more familiar with my city.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're up for it, I'd love for you to dive into some of the fan
            stories I've had the privilege of capturing or explore the awesome
            places my city has to offer. I'm stoked that you've taken the time
            to check out my website. Thanks for swinging by!
